    "\n",
    "The analysis examined the effect of varying vehicle capacity on the total cost in the VRPSPD model. The results indicate that a vehicle capacity of 50 is insufficient to meet all demands, as the model could not find a feasible solution at this level. This suggests that the minimum capacity required for feasibility is higher than 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the vehicle capacity reached 75, the total cost stabilized at 60.0, and increasing capacity beyond this point had no impact on cost. This indicates that the routing is already optimized at this level, and additional capacity does not provide further cost benefits. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a practical standpoint, a vehicle capacity range of 75 to 100 is sufficient to ensure feasibility while avoiding unnecessary vehicle space. Increasing capacity beyond this level does not improve efficiency, suggesting that the primary limitation is in routing rather than vehicle capacity constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaway from this analysis is that optimizing vehicle routes is more critical than increasing capacity. Future improvements should focus on refining routing strategies rather than allocating additional capacity beyond what is necessary to meet demand."
